                <p class="animate">Mandala System Pvt. Ltd. is one of the leaders in the areas of software development
                    and IT consulting. It is established to complement the information technology solutions and business
                    transformation methodologies. It has more than five years experience in software development under
                    client /server and component based environment. Within a short span of time it has established
                    itself as one of the leading vendors in the software development field.


                    Our software development platform are based on Oracle and Microsoft SQL server at the back–end and
                    Developer/2000, C++ and Java at the front-end on different operating systems such as Novell Netware,
                    Windows NT and Unix.


                    We follow state-of-the-art design methodology that covers today’s component/web based and GUI
                    software development as in object oriented design methodologies. Older styles of design
                    methodologies, such as Structured Analysis/Structured Design (SA/SD), lack features of client/server
                    and GUI environment. We, thus, avoid using these methods and using truly object-oriented design
                    methodologies.


                    Two of our trusted products - Management Information System for Industries and Airlines - and many
                    other turn-key software development projects have gained customer satisfaction and have included
